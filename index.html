<h1>About</h1>

<p>Greetings, my name is Michael "Brandon" Morris. I graduated in May 2018 from the University of South Carolina Honors College with a  My language of choice is C#, and I have experience with a variety of engines, frameworks, and tools including:</p>

<p>In my spare time, I stay in shape by playing pickleball and racquetball. As a board member of the South Carolina Racquetball Players Association, I assist with the planning and running of our annual state singles and doubles championships. I also help coach the University of South Carolina racquetball club team, of which I was an officer during my time at school. My current personal programming project (private at the moment) is a web application to replace the existing and outdated tournament software used for pickleball and racquetball tournaments. I also enjoy gaming, and will play a variety of genres including co-op games with my friends, casual e-sports, and single-player titles.</p>
